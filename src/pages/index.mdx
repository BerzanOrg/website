# My Name's Berzan




I am Berzan. I was born in 2005 in [Antalya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antalya). I've loved science & business since my childhood. <br/>
As I grew up, I became more interested in computers and technology.<br/>
My interests are virtual machines like [EVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Virtual_machine), [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine), [eBPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF), compilers and distributed systems. 

I'm a [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/) Navigator and a [Superteam Turkey](https://tr.superteam.fun/) member. <br/>
I currently build [various projects](https://github.com/BerzanOrg?tab=repositories) including [a rollup with its own AMM on Mina Protocol](https://docs.xane.berzan.org). <br/>

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BerzanOrg), [GitHub](https://github.com/BerzanOrg), [Telegram](https://t.me/BerzanOrg), or via [e-mail](mailto:me@berzan.org).

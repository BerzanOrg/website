# Who I am

My name is Berzan. I was born in 2005 in [Antalya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antalya), the most beautiful city.<br/>
I've been interested in the universe and science since I was a baby.

I grew up with computers which slowly but surely made me interested in tech.

I've been programming since 2020 and never stopped since then.<br/>
I've dedicated myself to Web3 development full-time after the end of 2023.

I'm interested in VMs like [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) and [EVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Virtual_machine), compilers, distributed systems, databases, advanced data structures, [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) and low-level optimizations.

I am currently building multiple projects in Web3 ecosystem including [an AMM with its own ZK rollup](https://docs.xane.berzan.org) on Mina Protocol.

I am a [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/) Navigator and a [Superteam Turkey](https://tr.superteam.fun/) Member.

I enjoy using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. <br/>
And [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) makes frontend development bearable for me.

I love learning the logic behind concepts, and sometimes write [posts](/posts) about them.

You might call o1js an embedded [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

## Basics

A `Field` is the founding data **structure** in the context of zk circuits.

### Usage

```ts
const age = Field.from(18)
```

```ts
const age = new Field(18)
```

```ts
const age = Field(18)
```

<br />

```html
<button class="bg-red-400">Click</button>
```

Build the project with the command below:

```sh
anchor buildanchor buildanchor buildanchor buildanchor buildanchor buildanchor buildancho
```
